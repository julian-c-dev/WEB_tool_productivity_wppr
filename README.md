Designed and Developed by Julian Cantera.

Tech: HTML, CSS/Sass & JavaScript ES6.

Issues: 
// It is not a responsive web. I was thinking more about improving my JavaScript skills than make the tool suitable for mobiles & tablets (actually is a tool for desktops).
// The tool does not generate any output, except the user's selections. 

// I have to make the tool functional => possible solution: https://html2canvas.hertzen.com/
// I must open a topic about how to solve the previous point on the starkflow web.
